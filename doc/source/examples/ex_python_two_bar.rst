Two-bar truss
=============

This example shows how to create a REP project solving a two-bar truss problem with Python.

For the original problem descriptions, see R.L. Fox, *Optimization Methods in Engineering Design*, Addison Wesley, 1971.
Also see `Optimization Methods for Engineering Design <https://apmonitor.com/me575/uploads/Main/optimization_book.pdf>`_.

     You can download the :download:`ZIP file <../../../build/python_two_bar_truss_problem.zip>` for the two-bar truss
     example and use a tool such as 7Zip to extract the files.

Here is the ``project_setup.py`` script for this example:
