Two-bar truss
=============

This example shows how to create an HPS project solving a two-bar truss problem with Python.

For the original problem description, see R.L. Fox, *Optimization Methods in Engineering Design*, Addison Wesley, 1971.
Also see `Optimization Methods for Engineering Design <https://apmonitor.com/me575/uploads/Main/optimization_book.pdf>`_.

Here is the ``project_setup.py`` script for this example:
